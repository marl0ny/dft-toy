# Exploring the Discrete Fourier Transfrom Using Numpy, Sympy, Matplotlib, and Tkinter
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marl0ny/dft-toy/master/screenshot.png" />
To run this program, first ensure that `python3` with the modules `tkinter`, `numpy`, `sympy`, and `matplotlib` 
are installed on your computer. The first of these comes with Python. The other three can be installed with
`pip3` by typing `pip3 install numpy sympy matplotlib` in the command line. Now clone or download this
repository and run the file `main.py`. You should obtain a GUI with two graphs and GUI controls on the right side.
The top graph displays the function in position space, while the bottom graph displays its Fourier transform.
To enter a new function, type a new function into the `Enter function f(x)` entry box, or pick a new function
in the `Preset function f(x)` dropdown menu. The function entered can contain any variable, where those
variables that are not x can be controlled with the sliders.

Enjoy!
